"Blackjack starts with players making bets.\n"
"Dealer deals 2 cards to the players face up\nand two to himself ( 1 card "
"face up, the other face down ).\n\n"

"Blackjack card values: Numerical cards count their face value in "
"blackjack.\n"
"Face cards count as 10 and the ace can count as either 1 or 11.\n"
"The total of any hand is the sum of the card values in the hand.\n\n"

"Players must decide whether to hit, stand, double down, or split.\n"
"Hit: Take another card from the dealer.\n"
"Stand: Keep your hand as it is.\n"
"Double Down: Take only one more card from the dealer and double the "
"orignal bet.\n"
"Split: Split your orignal hand into two new hands.\n"
"Can only split when the orignal hand contains two cards of the same "
"value.\n\n"

"The dealer acts last and must hit on 16 or less and stand on 17 through "
"21.\n"
"Players win when their hand totals higher than dealerâ€™s hand,\nor they "
"have 21 or less when the dealer busts\n"
