# Building

Make sure that opensplice is installed in your home directory, such that
`~/OSPL/release.com` is a file. 

Edit `~/OSPL/release.com` and comment-out the line setting `OSPL_HOME`

Run `./make.sh`, it should handle everything else for you

Any arguments passed to `./make.sh` will be forwarded directly to `make`
after the OpenSplice situation is taken care of.
